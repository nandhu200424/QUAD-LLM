# QUAD-LLM
🚀 Introducing QuadLLM – My First GitHub Project Showcase!  I'm excited to share my first repository on GitHub: QuadLLM — an AI-powered agent that compares outputs from multiple LLMs for richer, more balanced responses.
# QuadLLM 🔀🧠  
A Multi-LLM AI Agent | Demo + Architecture Showcase

Welcome to **QuadLLM**, a project designed to explore how multiple large language models (LLMs) can be used collaboratively to generate diverse and balanced responses. This repository serves as a **technical showcase**, not a full open-source release.

---

## 🚀 About the Project

**QuadLLM** routes a single prompt to **mutiple different LLM providers** (e.g., Gemini and llama), collects their responses, and displays them side by side. The goal is to compare reasoning styles, creativity, and usefulness — giving users more nuanced output for critical thinking or content generation.
